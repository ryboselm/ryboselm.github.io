title: Making Geometric Origami
---
Origami typically connotes paper cranes and leapfrogs, and making simple origami animals is therapeutic and fun! However, about a year ago I discovered and became interested in *geometric origami*, which deals with making tessellations and other geometric patterns using the medium of paper (or other equivalent material). To give a tiny overview of mathematical origami, flat-folding origami obeys the following laws:

1. All valid crease patterns are two-colorable.
2. Maekawa's Theorem: At any vertex the number of valley and mountain folds must differ by two.
3. Kawasaki's Theorem: The sum of alternating angles around any vertex will equal 180 degrees.
4. A sheet can never penetrate a fold.

For a folded piece of flat-folded origami, these laws are self-evidently true. If one begins from a flat sheet and goes about a procedure of making one fold at a time, none of the laws can be broken at any step, so any resulting structure will necessarily satisfy all the laws. But not all crease patterns -- the pattern of straight line folds on a flat sheet you get after completely unfolded a piece of origami -- will yield valid flat-folded origami structures. Interestingly, given a crease pattern on a flat sheet, determining whether it can be flat-folded is an <a href="http://origametry.net/papers/flatsurvey.pdf">NP-complete</a> problem.

Anyway, I've included a bunch of origami that I've created below! Most of them are tessellation designs taken from Eric Gjerde's Origami Tessellations: Awe-Inspiring Geometric Designs book. One thing that I've learned from making these tessellations is that even if you conceptually get how the paper should be folded, actually getting it right in practice is sometimes a multi-hour struggle because we inevitably make imperfect folds, and paper is only a crude approximation of the infinitesimally thin and infinitely durable material used for theoretical origami. 

These origami tessellations were made by first folding a grid-like precreased "substrate" of either squares or triangles (you can see the pattern of many tiny triangles and squares in all of these pics!). The actual folds seen were made mostly using these pre-existing gridlines, but some of the more challenging patterns required abandoning the grid pattern and making even more tiny folds. There was also a diverse catalogue of techniques for "pleating" and "twisting" needed in order to craft these tessellations. These took a long time to learn, and even longer to get right when working with paper triangles that were roughly half a centimeter across.

These are the guides for creating a basic pleat and a basic twist, respectively.

Also, this one is a 3D origami model I made from another book. What is interesting about it is that it is inherently 3D -- the paper is *supposed* to be convex by design.
