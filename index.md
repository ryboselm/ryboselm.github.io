Hi, I'm Ryan! I study computer science and applied math at Columbia. I'm interested in ideas from theoretical CS, information theory, statistical physics, and more broadly any area yielding an intriguing angle on the world. On campus, I'm the president/co-founder of Columbia University Science Olympiad, and I'm also involved with the Columbia Robotics Club on the Self-Driving Car project. 

email me! I'm happy to talk!
