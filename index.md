Hi! I'm Ryan, a 4th year undergrad at Columbia University studying Computer Science with minors in Applied Math and Applied Physics. I'm interested in topics within quantum information science, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/) on quantum computing. Previously, I worked with Kara Lamb and Marcus van Lier-Walqui on using machine learning for climate science as a part of the 2022 [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/) REU.

On campus, I'm involved with [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO) which I co-founded in 2022 and led to successfully organize the first Science Olympiad invitational tournament at Columbia with over 400 high school participants in our first year. In my free time I enjoy running and reading. Some recent favorite books: The Remembrances of Earth's Past Trilogy by Cixin Liu, Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, Crying in H-Mart by Michelle Zauner, and the Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges.
