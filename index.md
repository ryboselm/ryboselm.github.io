I study computer science, math, and physics at Columbia University. Here are some of the things I do:

In high school, I was an avid competitor in [Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/). Recently, I helped create [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO), Columbia's alumni chapter of Science Olympiad. We organize an annual tournament at Columbia for teams of high school students and volunteer at local regional tournaments. I am currently co-president of CUSO.

Over the past summer, I worked at the intersection of machine learning/artificial intelligence and climate science as a part of Columbia's [LEAP REU](https://leap.columbia.edu/). I worked with neural networks as surrogate models of cloud microphysical process schemes, for eventual incorporation into better, ML-driven global climate models.

In my free time, I love to read and run. Some books I've greatly enjoyed in the past year: [Invisible Cities](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Cities-Italo-Calvino/dp/0156453800) by Italo Calvino, [The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle](https://www.amazon.com/Wind-Up-Bird-Chronicle-Novel/dp/0679775439) by Haruki Murakami, and [Quantum Computing Since Democritus](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565) by Scott Aaronson.
