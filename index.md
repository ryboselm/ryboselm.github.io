Hi! I'm Ryan, a 4th year undergrad at Columbia University studying Computer Science with minors in Applied Math and Applied Physics. I'm interested in topics within quantum information science, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/) on quantum computing. Previously, I worked with Kara Lamb and Marcus van Lier-Walqui on using machine learning for climate science as a part of the 2022 [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/) REU.

On campus, I'm involved with [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO) which I co-founded in 2022 and led to successfully organize the first Science Olympiad invitational tournament at Columbia with over 400 high school participants in our first year. In my free time I enjoy running and reading. Some recent favorite books: The Remembrances of Earth's Past Trilogy by Cixin Liu, Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, Crying in H-Mart by Michelle Zauner, and the Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges.

#### Teaching
Being a teaching assistant has been a great experience for me. I have TA'd for
* COMS 4281: Intro to Quantum Computing with Henry Yuen (Fall 2023)
* COMS 3261: Computer Science Theory with Xi Chen (Spring 2023)
* CSOR 4231: Analysis of Algorithms I with Mihalis Yannakakis (Fall 2022)

#### Miscellaneous Writing
* [Lecture Notes on Electrical Networks and Graphs](assets/Electrical%20Networks%20and%20Graphs.pdf)
* [k-means++: A Survey (Advanced Algorithms Final Project)](assets/k_means++_A_Survey.pdf)
* [Unsupervised Learning Final Project](assets/Unsupervised_Learning_Final_Report.pdf)
* [Presentation on Randomized Complexity Classes](assets/Complexity_of_Randomization.pdf)
