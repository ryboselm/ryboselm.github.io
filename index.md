Hi, I'm Ryan! I study computer science and applied math at Columbia. This summer, I conducted computational chemistry research at UT Austin. In the past I learned a ton of earth science and chemistry, and I'm always interested in the ways these fields intersect with my current interests.

On campus, I'm the co-president and co-founder of Columbia University Science Olympiad, and I'm also involved with the Columbia Robotics Club on the Self-Driving Car project. I enjoy going for runs in Riverside and Central Park, reading magical realist fiction, and collecting PDFs on {quantum information science, applied category theory, geometric origami} that I'll find time to read one of these days.

Say hi to me at <ryan.anselm@columbia.edu>!
