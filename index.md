Hi! I am a 4th year undergraduate at Columbia University studying Computer Science with minors in Applied Math and Applied Physics. I'm interested in quantum information theory and theoretical computer science. I am fortunate to be advised by [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/). Previously, I worked with Kara Lamb and Marcus van Lier-Walqui on machine learning for atmospheric science as a part of the 2022 [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/) REU. At Columbia, I co-founded [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO), which organized a Science Olympiad tournament for 400 high schoolers in our first year.

#### Teaching
I have TA'd for
* COMS 4232: Advanced Algorithms (Spring 2024)
* COMS 4281: Intro to Quantum Computing (Fall 2023)
* COMS 3261: Computer Science Theory (Spring 2023)
* CSOR 4231: Analysis of Algorithms I (Fall 2022)

#### Projects & Writing
* [A Probabilistic Model for Quantum State Tomography (Probabilistic Machine Learning Final Project)](https://github.com/ryboselm/QuantumStateTomography)
* [Lecture Notes on Electrical Networks and Graphs (TCS Reading Group)](assets/Electrical%20Networks%20and%20Graphs.pdf)
* [k-means++: A Survey (Advanced Algorithms Final Project)](assets/k_means++_A_Survey.pdf)
* [Unsupervised Document Retrieval by Contrastive Learning (Unsupervised Learning Final Project)](assets/Unsupervised_Learning_Final_Report.pdf)
* [Talk on Randomized Complexity (TCS Reading Group)](assets/Complexity_of_Randomization.pdf)
