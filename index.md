Hi! I'm Ryan, a 4th year undergrad at Columbia University studying Computer Science with minors in Applied Math and Applied Physics. I'm interested in quantum information science, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. Recently, I co-founded [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO) and successfully organized the first Science Olympiad invitational tournament at Columbia with 400+ high school participants attending. Previously, I worked with Kara Lamb and Marcus van Lier-Walqui on using machine learning for climate science as a part of the [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/) REU.

 In my free time I like to run in Manhattan and read interesting books. Some recent favorites: Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, Crying in H-Mart by Michelle Zauner, and the Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges.
