I am a fourth year undergrad studying computer science, math, and physics at Columbia University. A little bit about me:

[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is a high school extracurricular I competed in which was instrumental in shaping my interests towards science and technology. My eyes were opened to the wonders of physics, chemistry, and geosciences thanks to my participation in Science Olympiad, and I am deeply indebted to this influence! Because of my continued interest in staying involved as an alum, I founded [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO) in 2022 and successfully organized the first ever invitational Science Olympiad tournament at Columbia with 480+ high school students competing in it.

During the summer of 2022, I worked on machine learning and climate science research as a part of Columbia's [LEAP REU](https://leap.columbia.edu/). I worked with neural networks as surrogate models of cloud microphysical process schemes, for eventual incorporation into better, ML-driven global climate models.

I am also an enthusiast for reading and running. Currently reading Moby Dick and training for the San Francisco Marathon. Some of my favorite books: Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, Collected Fictions by Jorge Luis Borges, and Crying in H-Mart by Michelle Zauner.
