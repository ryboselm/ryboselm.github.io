Hi! I am a 4th year undergraduate at Columbia University studying Computer Science, with minors in Applied Math and Applied Physics. I'm interested in topics within quantum information science, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/) on research in quantum computing. I have previously worked with Kara Lamb and Marcus van Lier-Walqui on using machine learning for climate science as a part of the 2022 [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/) REU.

One thing I'm very proud of is that I co-founded [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO), which organized the first Science Olympiad tournament at Columbia with over 400 high school competitors in our first year. In my free time I enjoy reading, running, hiking, learning math, doomscrolling, etc. Some of my favorite books: The Remembrances of Earth's Past Trilogy by Cixin Liu, Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, and the Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges.
