Hi! I'm Ryan, a 4th year undergrad at Columbia University studying Computer Science with minors in Applied Math and Applied Physics. I'm interested in topics within quantum information science, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/) on quantum computing research. Previously, I worked with Kara Lamb and Marcus van Lier-Walqui on using machine learning for climate science as a part of the [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/) REU.

In my free time I enjoy running and reading. Some recent favorites: The Remembrances of Earth's Past Trilogy by Cixin Liu, Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, Crying in H-Mart by Michelle Zauner, and the Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges. I also founded [Columbia University Science Olympiad](https://www.columbiascioly.com/) (CUSO) and helped successfully organized the first Science Olympiad invitational tournament at Columbia with over 400 high school participants.
