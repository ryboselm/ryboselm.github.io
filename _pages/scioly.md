Science Olympiad is a middle/high school science competition in which teams of 15 compete in 23 different events, ranging across many disciplines of science and engineering.
I competed for 3 years in high school and since graduating have been active as an event supervisor for various tournaments including UT, MIT, UPenn, and Nationals.
More recently, I've been busy laying the foundations for a Science Olympiad alumni organization and invitational tournament at Columbia University. Hopefully, all things happening smoothly, it can take place for the first time in 2022-2023!
