Science Olympiad is a science competition in which teams of 15 compete in 23 different events.
I competed for 3 years in high school and since graduating have been active as an event supervisor for various tournaments including UT, MIT, UPenn, and Nationals.
More recently, I've been busy starting a Science Olympiad invitational tournament at Columbia University (happening 2022-2023)!
